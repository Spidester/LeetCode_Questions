/*2828. Check if a String Is an Acronym of Words

Given an array of strings words and a string s, determine if s is an acronym of words.

The string s is considered an acronym of words if it can be formed by concatenating the first character of each string in words in order. For example, "ab" can be formed from ["apple", "banana"], but it can't be formed from ["bear", "aardvark"]
Return true if s is an acronym of words, and false otherwise.

Example:
Input: words = ["alice","bob","charlie"], s = "abc"
Output: true
Explanation: The first character in the words "alice", "bob", and "charlie" are 'a', 'b', and 'c', respectively. Hence, s = "abc" is the acronym. */

class Solution {
public:
    bool isAcronym(vector<string>& words, string s) {
        if(words.size()!=s.size()){
            return false;
        }
        for(int i=0; i<words.size(); i++){
            if(s[i]!=words[i][0]){
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};
