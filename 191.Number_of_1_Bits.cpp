/*191. Number of 1 Bits

Write a function that takes the binary representation of an unsigned
integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

Example:
Input: n = 00000000000000000000000000001011
Output: 3
Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000000001011 has a total of three '1' bits.*/

class Solution {
public:
    int hammingWeight(uint32_t n) {
        int count=0;
        while(n!=0){
            if(n&1){
            count++;
            }
            n = n>>1;
        }
        return count;
    }
};
